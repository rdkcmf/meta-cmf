Subject: [PATCH] DELIA-31917: Converted Error to Warning.

        1)we need to provide a way to share complete
        directories till we have the functionality working.
        There has to be a way provided in the framework for it.
        At this point it is missing hence  we are patching to
        allow it for now till there is a new change in framework.
        2)Refactoring LXC patches to comcast layer.
        3)Using weak assignment baseline LXC version to may 14,2019 CMF version
